I'm pretty set in my ways but still optimistic for a home and family that would suit me! I really don't like other dogs and it's unlikely that I'll like cats any better. Respectful and savvy children would probably be alright but I can be a little off-putting sometimes so no-one too timid or faint of heart, kay? I'm ready for walks, naps, adventures abound! Let's get a move on! there is so much to see and do! So many beds left un-napped in! Come meet me today!"

I don't want to face any dogs. I don't like them. I've never met a cat, not sure if I want to. If you're not a dog I'm sure we'll get along great. I really enjoy giving hugs!

Her previous owners described Misty as very loveable and said she even knows a few commands. Misty was reported to be good with older children and cats, but does not do well with smaller dogs or young children. Misty had an incident several years ago when she bit a small child who was picking food off the floor. We are trying to get Misty out to a rescue in a foster based setting, who has the resources to train and work with her in finding her forever home, preferably without children. During examination, Misty was found to have moderate dental disease and two masses that seem most likely to be lipomas."
